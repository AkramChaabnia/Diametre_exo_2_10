## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

The goal of this project is to implement an algorithm that determines the diameter of each connected component in a graph using the Dijkstra algorithm. The project consists of a Java implementation that computes the diameter of connected components.

## üöÄ Code Structure <a name = "code_structure"></a>

The project includes the following files:

- `App.java`: Contains the main algorithm that computes the diameter of each connected component using the Dijkstra algorithm.
  - `findDiameter(Graph graph, int num_v)`: Finds the diameter of connected components in the graph.
  - `calculateComponentDiameter(Graph graph, int start, int num_v)`: Calculates the diameter of a specific component.
  - `calculatePathDistance(Graph graph, LinkedList<Integer> path)`: Calculates the distance of a path in the graph.
  - `resetGraph(Graph graph)`: Resets the graph's vertices.
  - `Dijkstra(Graph graph, int start, int end, int numberV)`: Implements Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path.
- `WeightedGraph.java`: Defines classes to represent a weighted graph, including vertices and edges.

## üìà Algorithm Complexity <a name="algorithm_complexity"></a>

The algorithm used in this project, based on Dijkstra's algorithm to determine the diameter of each connected component, showcases varying complexities influenced by multiple factors:

Vertices (V): The algorithm traverses each vertex to identify connected components, contributing to a runtime proportional to the number of vertices.

Edges (E): During graph exploration, the algorithm computes shortest paths between vertices, where the number of edges affects distance calculations within connected components.

Graph Structure: The connectivity and density of the graph significantly impact the algorithm's performance. Dense graphs or those with a high number of vertices may increase computational complexity.

Considering these factors, the estimated complexity is O(V _ (V + E) _ log V), reflecting the traversal of vertices and edges while determining the diameter of connected components using Dijkstra's algorithm. This complexity accounts for the algorithm's operations specific to computing connected component diameters in the given graph structure.
